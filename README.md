# Algorithm Dijkstra

This project is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm . Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

`The structure of the code`

The code consists of the Graph class and the main() function. The Graph class encapsulates all data and functions associated with the graph. It contains methods to read the adjacency matrix, find the shortest distances, and output the results.
